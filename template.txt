Dear NWS {location} Team,

My name is Levi. I am a first-year Computer Science Master's student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Over the past two years, I have worked as a machine learning researcher, with active and pending publications in applied computer vision and audio generation. Beyond my research, I also have experience as a corporate software engineer and data analyst.

Meteorology and climate modeling are long-standing personal interests of mine, though, until this point, I had not identified clear opportunities to merge these passions with my machine learning and programming background.

This summer, I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to volunteer at the NWS in {location}, {state}, in any small way that I can. I am particularly interested in working tasks related to data collection and analysis; however, I am open to helping in any way I can.

Please let me know if volunteering this summer is a possibility. Thank you for your consideration â€“ I look forward to your reply.
