  <p>Dear NWS {location} Team,</p>

  <p>
    My name is <strong>Levi Harris</strong> and I am a first‑year
    <em>Computer Science</em> Master’s student at the
    University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.  Over the past two years I have
    worked as a machine‑learning researcher with publications in applied computer
    vision and audio generation. I have also served as a corporate software
    engineer and data analyst.
  </p>

  <p>
    Meteorology and climate modelling are long‑standing personal interests, and
    this summer I would love to volunteer at the NWS office in
    <strong>{location}, {state}</strong>. I am particularly interested in
    projects that involve data collection or analysis, but I am happy to help in
    any way that is useful.
  </p>

  <p>
    Please let me know if a volunteer position might be possible. Thank you for
    your time and consideration.
  </p>

    Best regards,<br>
    <strong>Levi Harris</strong><br>
